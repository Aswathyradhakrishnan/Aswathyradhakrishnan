# 👋 Hi, I'm Aswathy Radhakrishnan

🎯 Applied AI | GenAI | R&D | NLP | GIS | Multimodal AI  
👩‍💻 Data Scientist (R&D-focused) working on cutting-edge LLM, CV, and spatial intelligence use cases.

## 🧠 What I Do

🔬 I build and prototype intelligent systems that combine traditional ML, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches to solve real-world problems.  
🧪 Most of my work is PoC-driven, combining research and engineering to validate emerging ideas and explore feasibility.

## 🚀 Projects (Selected Highlights)

- **📄 GenAI for Document Intelligence**  
  Extract handwritten text and sketches from GIS-related documents using Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), Florence, and Azure Document Intelligence.

- **🌍 SpatialLM & MASt3R-SLAM**  
  Prototyped 2D-to-3D spatial understanding and SLAM from video inputs for GIS applications using SpatialLM and MASt3R-SLAM.

- **📡 Pole Detection (Multimodal)**  
  Combined Florence, YOLOWorld, and EasyOCR to detect and classify poles (assets) from urban scenes using both GenAI and classical CV methods.

- **🛰 ESRI Deep Learning Models**  
  Implemented corridor mapping and aerial data-based DL pipelines using ESRI's GIS tools.

- **📉 Customer Churn Prediction + GenAI Explainability**  
  Built ML models for churn prediction and enhanced post-hoc explanations using GenAI agents.

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Research Platform**  
  Built a CrewAI-based multi-agent system to conduct web-scale competitive research and insight generation.
